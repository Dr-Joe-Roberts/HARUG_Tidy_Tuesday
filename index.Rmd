# Tidy data - recap `r emo::ji("broom")`

.medium[ 
- Data can be presented in many different formats

- Tidy data is usually the easiest format to use with R 

- Core principle for the `tidyverse` suite of packages

- I am about to share a .xlsx file via MS Teams chat

- Turn this file into a tidy data set using the 3 rules below

- **Hint**: data dictionaries should be in a separate tab

# What is Tidy Tuesday?

> A weekly data project aimed at the R ecosystem. As this project was borne out of the R4DS Online Learning Community and the `R for Data Science` textbook, an emphasis was placed on understanding how to summarize and arrange data to make meaningful charts with `ggplot2`, `tidyr`, `dplyr`, and other tools in the `tidyverse` ecosystem.

<br>

.medium[
- Data sets are uploaded to the Tidy Tuesday [GitHub](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday) 

- Uploads contain data background, download instructions and a data dictionary

- Data are not always tidy - some wrangling is usually required!

- Let's look at a Tidy Tuesday data set...

# Food consumption and CO2 emissions

> This data on annual CO2 emissions per person for 130 nations worldwide was originally compiled by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) in 2018. On 2020-02-18 it was uploaded as a .csv file to the Tidy Tuesday [GitHub repository](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2020/2020-02-18/readme.md).

# What does this data set contain?

```{r get-tt-data, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, include = FALSE}
food_consumption <- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2020/2020-02-18/food_consumption.csv')
```

```{r glimpse-tt-data}
glimpse(food_consumption)  # Similar to print in base R - great to look at data
```

# Activity 2  (20 mins) `r emo::ji("hourglass")`

.medium[ 
- Let's start with a question - **which food category has the highest CO2 emissions?**

- We can answer this by visualising the data!
]

--

.medium[
- I want you to recreate the following plot where I have done exactly this

- I will post the link to the data in the MS Teams chat

# Next meeting (2020-04-29)

.medium[
- We'll take a deeper dive into food consumption and CO2 emissions data set

- Aim to answer some specific questions

- Explore the data more with data visualisations

- Basic linear regression modeling

# I propose a challenge for the next meeting

.medium[
- Produce your own data visualisation from the food-CO2 data 

- Make it as complicated or as simple as you like

- The key is to think of a question you want answer using the data

- Show and discuss at the next **HARUG** meeting (2020-04-29)
